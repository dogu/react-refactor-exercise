# React Refactor Exercise
This repo contains a simple react refactor exercise where you can refactor
a Class component into a functional component, using hooks.
The component can be found in `src/App.js`. The goal is to refactor the component
without breaking any of the tests defined in `src/App.test.js`.

Before starting your exercise:
1. Install dependencies (`npm ci` or `yarn install`)
2. Start jest in watch mode by running `npm test` or (`yarn test`).
3. Code!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
